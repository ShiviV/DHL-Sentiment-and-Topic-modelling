I waited for a few days for Sami to bring a package and when he does, he puts it in front of the door and then leaves.
There was no one at home, so you understand, someone passing by took it and left.
I get a message from DHL and it tells me that I received the package.
DHL means:
D for Dangerous, H for Hooligans and L for Liars.

I was charged $1000 for transporting one suitcase from the U.S. to Portugal. Apparently, I was not given the correct forms that would itemize and show the value of my shipment. The suitcase was stuck in customs in Portugal for two weeks; there was a customer service number for DHL Portugal but it would only ring through to an automated message and hang up. I finally drove an hour to the DHL office to straighten the issue out; they said that they needed a form that they had sent to be returned through their website. Their website would not allow me to attach and return the document. I contacted DHL in the U.S. For the first time, someone was helpful and said that I could send them the form and that they would forward it on; however two days later I was told by DHL Portugal that I had not fulfilled their requirement and that my suitcase would be immediately returned to the U.S. It was impossible to get help from DHL in Portugal and the help from the U.S. was difficult to find and many times clueless. On top of everything else, none of my $1000+ was refunded for the incredible inconvenience. I'd never do business with DHL again and I'd strongly recommend you don't either.",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67ddf088f4039caf3bdd8daf,2025-03-22T06:34:21Z

The latest debacle was a parcel ordered from an online retailer on Next Day delivery on Thursday 13th March. The DHL tracking information said it had been received at their depot and was then out for delivery at 10:36 on Friday 14th March and was stop number 44. Sorry, but for starters who, when they have at least 44 parcels to deliver, doesn't start delivering til after 10:30? So it already didn't look good...

The tracker stopped updating at 'The driver is heading to stop 39' at around 7pm and then stated that my parcel had been signed back into the depot at around 8pm. Despite it being their fault it wasn't delivered, no attempt was made at redelivery until Monday 17th March, when I wasn't in - I had requested the delivery for the Friday for a reason, knowing the parcel had to be signed for and I would be in. As I wasn't in, the parcel was left half hanging through the letterbox and wasn't signed for because I wasn't there - for reference, the parcel was an expensive piece of PC hardware.

Customer services were, unsurprisingly, unhelpful and avoiding answering any questions and just saying sorry for the delay. Eventually, I got a 'the depot have said the drivers will be spoken to' about the delivery without a signature and hanging out of the letterbox aspect but the overall delay was ignored. I pressed for a reason for the delay and was eventually lied to, being told my parcel was ""unable to be delivered as it could not be located at the time of the delivery attempt."" And still no explanation as to why a parcel couldn't be found in a van - it was hardly a needle in a haystack...

...However, the fact that is, they have told an outright lie in the face of the facts! Their own tracker shows that the driver made delivery stop 38 then turned round and went back to the depot - the tracker said the driver was heading for stop 39 for about an hour then said they were back at the depot. No attempt was made to deliver my parcel, it's blatantly obvious that the driver made stop number 38 and then turned around and went back to the depot, either because their driving time was up or they decided it was too late and they wanted to go home.

I confess I don't know exactly how it works but either DHL overloaded the driver and there was no way they would be able to deliver all the parcels in their driving time, or they just decided ""it's getting late, I think I'll go home."" Regardless, DHL continue to avoid giving answers about this and then when pressed, have just lied instead.

And to be clear, after numerous poor experiences with DHL over the years (later deliveries, insisting something has been delivered when it hasn't, leaving signed for parcels at someone else's address without a signature to even leaving a parcel in the middle of the road at the top of the driveway!) I avoid them. However, I didn't know the company I purchased the product from used DHL until it was too late, and, true to form, with their latest 'delivery attempt' they've shown me justified in avoiding them!

Incompetence and lies. Not a great look...",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67da9c64f8f3312b22f02239,2025-03-22T06:34:47Z

Drove around for 2 hours, 3 of the shops that were open, could not recognize my barcode (plus info on opening times on DHL site were wrong) The 4th store, shut down a long time ago. So, back home and issued another barcode, so Sunday, about 3 hours driving around, same story. Finally Sunday night, a collection was scheduled for Monday, anytime from 8am to 6pm, had to rush to the library to print a label at 9am (the very reason i opted for the service in the 1st place, no printer) - So, i waited in all-day, at 16.45 i contacted customer services who assured me, it will be picked up by 6pm. That came and went, at 6.15 approx, back to customer services, who wanted to re schedule until the next day? Upon asking where my nearest depot was, i was informed it was about 7 miles away from my house and i had until 7pm if i wanted to drop it off, which i eventually had to, as my customer, the recipient of the item, had been waiting for delivery a.s.a.p - So i dropped it off myself, something i could have easily done in the 1st place.

In my case another delivery where they failed to deliver 2 days running, giving lies about running late until it's suddenly back at the depot after keeping me waiting in all day. Twice!
Added to that there's absolutely no way you can get hold of anyone to complain. I wonder why?!!
Everyone needs to complain to the companies that use them (mainly apple by the looks of it) . Frankly it IS their fault as they must be aware of the reputation of DHL and yet still choose to use them. Cheaper maybe?
So we all must ensure we complain to the company we buy the product from - it's the only way DHL will ever take any notice if the companies stop using them!

So, back home and issued another barcode, so Sunday, about 3 hours driving around, same story. Finally Sunday night, a collection was scheduled for Monday, anytime from 8am to 6pm, had to rush to the library to print a label at 9am (the very reason i opted for the service in the 1st place, no printer) - So, i waited in all-day, at 16.45 i contacted customer services who assured me, it will be picked up by 6pm. That came and went, at 6.15 approx, back to customer services, who wanted to re schedule until the next day? Upon asking where my nearest depot was, i was informed it was about 7 miles away from my house and i had until 7pm if i wanted to drop it off, which i eventually had to, as my customer, the recipient of the item, had been waiting for delivery a.s.a.p - So i dropped it off myself, something i could have easily done in the 1st place.

Despite it being their fault it wasn't delivered, no attempt was made at redelivery until Monday 17th March, when I wasn't in - I had requested the delivery for the Friday for a reason, knowing the parcel had to be signed for and I would be in. As I wasn't in, the parcel was left half hanging through the letterbox and wasn't signed for because I wasn't there - for reference, the parcel was an expensive piece of PC hardware.

Customer services were, unsurprisingly, unhelpful and avoiding answering any questions and just saying sorry for the delay. Eventually, I got a 'the depot have said the drivers will be spoken to' about the delivery without a signature and hanging out of the letterbox aspect but the overall delay was ignored. I pressed for a reason for the delay and was eventually lied to, being told my parcel was ""unable to be delivered as it could not be located at the time of the delivery attempt."" And still no explanation as to why a parcel couldn't be found in a van - it was hardly a needle in a haystack...

...However, the fact that is, they have told an outright lie in the face of the facts! Their own tracker shows that the driver made delivery stop 38 then turned round and went back to the depot - the tracker said the driver was heading for stop 39 for about an hour then said they were back at the depot. No attempt was made to deliver my parcel, it's blatantly obvious that the driver made stop number 38 and then turned around and went back to the depot, either because their driving time was up or they decided it was too late and they wanted to go home.

I confess I don't know exactly how it works but either DHL overloaded the driver and there was no way they would be able to deliver all the parcels in their driving time, or they just decided ""it's getting late, I think I'll go home."" Regardless, DHL continue to avoid giving answers about this and then when pressed, have just lied instead.

And to be clear, after numerous poor experiences with DHL over the years (later deliveries, insisting something has been delivered when it hasn't, leaving signed for parcels at someone else's address without a signature to even leaving a parcel in the middle of the road at the top of the driveway!) I avoid them. However, I didn't know the company I purchased the product from used DHL until it was too late, and, true to form, with their latest 'delivery attempt' they've shown me justified in avoiding them!

Incompetence and lies. Not a great look...",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67da9c64f8f3312b22f02239,2025-03-22T06:29:38Z

Added to that there's absolutely no way you can get hold of anyone to complain. I wonder why?!!
Everyone needs to complain to the companies that use them (mainly apple by the looks of it) . Frankly it IS their fault as they must be aware of the reputation of DHL and yet still choose to use them. Cheaper maybe?
So we all must ensure we complain to the company we buy the product from - it's the only way DHL will ever take any notice if the companies stop using them!
